# Quote from http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/fix_shake.html
# If you use a tolerance that is too large or a max-iteration count that is too
# small, the constraints will not be enforced very strongly, which can lead to
# poor energy conservation. You can test for this in your system by running a
# constant NVE simulation with a particular set of SHAKE parameters and
# monitoring the energy versus time.
# If both bonds in the angle are constrained then the angle will also be
# constrained if its type is in the list.
# If you define fixes (e.g. fix efield) that add additional force to the atoms
# after fix shake operates, then this fix will not take them into account and
# the time integration will typically not satisfy the SHAKE constraints.
# The solution for this is to make sure that fix shake is defined in your input
# script after any other fixes which add or change forces (to atoms that fix
# shake operates on).
