# Note on possible error:
# Out of range atoms - cannot compute PPPM
#    One or more atoms are attempting to map their charge to a PPPM grid point
#    that is not owned by a processor. This is likely for one of two reasons,
#    both of them bad. First, it may mean that an atom near the boundary of a
#    processor's sub-domain has moved more than 1/2 the neighbor skin distance
#    without neighbor lists being rebuilt and atoms being migrated to new
#    processors. This also means you may be missing pairwise interactions that
#    need to be computed. The solution is to change the re-neighboring criteria
#    via the neigh_modify command. The safest settings are "delay 0 every 1
#    check yes". Second, it may mean that an atom has moved far outside a
#    processor's sub-domain or even the entire simulation box. This indicates
#    bad physics, e.g. due to highly overlapping atoms, too large a timestep,
#    etc.

# The pppm style invokes a particle-particle particle-mesh solver (Hockney)
# which maps atom charge to a 3d mesh, uses 3d FFTs to solve Poisson's
# equation on the mesh, then interpolates electric fields on the mesh points
# back to the atoms. It is closely related to the particle-mesh Ewald
# technique (PME) (Darden) used in AMBER and CHARMM. The cost of traditional
# Ewald summation scales as N^(3/2) where N is the number of atoms in the
# system. The PPPM solver scales as Nlog(N) due to the FFTs, so it is almost
# always a faster choice (Pollock).
#
# [...]
#
# The specified accuracy determines the relative RMS error in per-atom forces
# calculated by the long-range solver. It is set as a dimensionless number,
# relative to the force that two unit point charges (e.g. 2 monovalent ions)
# exert on each other at a distance of 1 Angstrom. This reference value was
# chosen as representative of the magnitude of electrostatic forces in atomic
#  systems. Thus an accuracy value of 1.0e-4 means that the RMS error will be
#  a factor of 10000 smaller than the reference force.
#
# The accuracy setting is used in conjunction with the pairwise cutoff to
# determine the number of K-space vectors for style ewald or the grid size for
#  style pppm or msm.

    "kspace_modify slab 3.0"
# The slab keyword allows an Ewald or PPPM solver to be used for a systems that
# are periodic in x,y but non-periodic in z - a boundary setting of
# "boundary p p f". This is done by treating the system as if it were periodic
# in z, but inserting empty volume between atom slabs and removing dipole
# inter-slab interactions so that slab-slab interactions are effectively turned
# off. The volfactor value sets the ratio of the extended dimension in z divided
# by the actual dimension in z. The recommended value is 3.0. A larger value is
# inefficient; a smaller value introduces unwanted slab-slab interactions. The
# use of fixed boundaries in z means that the user must prevent particle
# migration beyond the initial z-bounds, typically by providing a wall-style
# fix. The methodology behind the slab option is explained in the paper by
# (Yeh). The slab option is also extended to non-neutral systems (Ballenegger).
#
# An alternative slab option can be invoked with the nozforce keyword in lieu of
# the volfactor. This turns off all kspace forces in the z direction. The
# nozforce option is not supported by MSM. For MSM, any combination of periodic,
# non-periodic, or shrink-wrapped boundaries can be set using boundary (the slab
# approximation in not needed). The slab keyword is not currently supported by
# Ewald or PPPM when using a triclinic simulation cell. The slab correction has
# also been extended to point dipole interactions (Klapp) in kspace_style
# ewald/disp.

# If you wish to apply an electric field in the Z-direction, in conjunction with
# the slab keyword, you should do it by adding explicit charged particles to the
# +/- Z surfaces. If you do it via the fix efield command, it will not give the
# correct dielectric constant due to the Yeh/Berkowitz (Yeh) correction not
# being compatible with how fix efield works.

# Use one or more global values as inputs every few timesteps, and average them
# over longer timescales. The resulting averages can be used by other output
# commands such as thermo_style custom, and can also be written to a file.
# Note that if no time averaging is done, this command can be used as a
# convenient way to simply output one or more global values to a file.
#
# The group specified with this command is ignored. However, note that specified
# values may represent calculations performed by computes and fixes which store
# their own "group" definitions.
#
# Each listed value can be the result of a compute or fix or the evaluation of
# an equal-style or vector-style variable. In each case, the compute, fix, or
# variable must produce a global quantity, not a per-atom or local quantity. If
# you wish to spatial- or time-average or histogram per-atom quantities from a
# compute, fix, or variable, then see the fix ave/chunk, fix ave/atom, or fix
# ave/histo commands. If you wish to sum a per-atom quantity into a single
# global quantity, see the compute reduce command.
#
# The Nevery, Nrepeat, and Nfreq arguments specify on what timesteps the input
# values will be used in order to contribute to the average. The final averaged
# quantities are generated on timesteps that are a multiple of Nfreq. The
# average is over Nrepeat quantities, computed in the preceding portion of the
# simulation every Nevery timesteps. Nfreq must be a multiple of Nevery and
# Nevery must be non-zero even if Nrepeat is 1. Also, the timesteps
# contributing to the average value cannot overlap, i.e. Nrepeat*Nevery
# can not exceed Nfreq.
#
# For example, if Nevery=2, Nrepeat=6, and Nfreq=100, then values on timesteps
# 90,92,94,96,98,100 will be used to compute the final average on timestep 100.
# Similarly for timesteps 190,192,194,196,198,200 on timestep 200, etc. If
# Nrepeat=1 and Nfreq = 100, then no time averaging is done; values are simply
# generated on timesteps 100,200,etc.
#
# Defaults: The option defaults are mode = scalar, ave = one, start = 0,
# no file output, format = %g, title 1,2,3 = strings as described above,
# and no off settings for any input values.
