# neigh 2.0 bin
# The style value selects what algorithm is used to build the list. The bin
# style creates the list by binning which is an operation that scales linearly
# with N/P, the number of atoms per processor where N = total number of atoms
# and P = number of processors. It is almost always faster than the nsq style
# which scales as (N/P)^2. For unsolvated small molecules in a non-periodic
# box, the nsq choice can sometimes be faster. Either style should give the
# same answers.
# Defaults: 2.0 bin for units = real or metal, skin = 2.0 Angstroms

neigh_modify    delay 2 every 1 check yes
# This command sets parameters that affect the building and use of pairwise
# neighbor lists. Depending on what pair interactions and other commands
# are defined, a simulation may require one or more neighbor lists.

# Note on possible error:
# Out of range atoms - cannot compute PPPM
#    One or more atoms are attempting to map their charge to a PPPM grid point
#    that is not owned by a processor. This is likely for one of two reasons,
#    both of them bad. First, it may mean that an atom near the boundary of a
#    processor’s sub-domain has moved more than 1/2 the neighbor skin distance
#    without neighbor lists being rebuilt and atoms being migrated to new
#    processors. This also means you may be missing pairwise interactions that
#    need to be computed. The solution is to change the re-neighboring criteria
#    via the neigh_modify command. The safest settings are “delay 0 every 1
#    check yes”. Second, it may mean that an atom has moved far outside a
#    processor’s sub-domain or even the entire simulation box. This indicates
#    bad physics, e.g. due to highly overlapping atoms, too large a timestep,
#    etc.

# notes
#
# Please also note that the switching distance is a matter of some debate in
# lipid bilayer simulations, and it is dependent to some extent on the nature
# of the lipid. Some studies have found that an 0.8-1.0 nm switch is
# appropriate, others argue 0.8-1.2 nm is best, and yet others stand by
# 1.0-1.2 nm. The user is cautioned to thoroughly investigate the force field
# literature for their chosen lipid(s) before beginning a simulation!

# Quote from http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/kspace_style.html:
# pppm value = accuracy
#  accuracy = desired relative error in forces
#
# The pppm style invokes a particle-particle particle-mesh solver (Hockney)
# which maps atom charge to a 3d mesh, uses 3d FFTs to solve Poisson’s
# equation on the mesh, then interpolates electric fields on the mesh points
# back to the atoms. It is closely related to the particle-mesh Ewald
# technique (PME) (Darden) used in AMBER and CHARMM. The cost of traditional
# Ewald summation scales as N^(3/2) where N is the number of atoms in the
# system. The PPPM solver scales as Nlog(N) due to the FFTs, so it is almost
# always a faster choice (Pollock).
#
# [...]
#
# The specified accuracy determines the relative RMS error in per-atom forces
# calculated by the long-range solver. It is set as a dimensionless number,
# relative to the force that two unit point charges (e.g. 2 monovalent ions)
# exert on each other at a distance of 1 Angstrom. This reference value was
# chosen as representative of the magnitude of electrostatic forces in atomic
#  systems. Thus an accuracy value of 1.0e-4 means that the RMS error will be
#  a factor of 10000 smaller than the reference force.
#
# The accuracy setting is used in conjunction with the pairwise cutoff to
# determine the number of K-space vectors for style ewald or the grid size for
#  style pppm or msm.
