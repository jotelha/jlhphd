# Apply a spring force independently to each atom in the group to tether it to
# its initial position. The initial position for each atom is its location at
# the time the fix command was issued. At each timestep, the magnitude of the
# force on each atom is -Kr, where r is the displacement of the atom from its
# current position to its initial position. The distance r correctly takes into
# account any crossings of periodic boundary by the atom since it was in its
# initial position.

# Quote from http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/minimize.html
# Perform an energy minimization of the system, by iteratively adjusting atom
# coordinates. Iterations are terminated when one of the stopping criteria is
# satisfied. At that point the configuration will hopefully be in local
# potential energy minimum. More precisely, the configuration should
# approximate a critical point for the objective function (see below), which
# may or may not be a local minimum.
#
#    etol = stopping tolerance for energy (unitless)
#    ftol = stopping tolerance for force (force units)
#    maxiter = max iterations of minimizer
#    maxeval = max number of force/energy evaluations
#
# Either or both of the etol and ftol values can be set to 0.0, in which case
# some other criterion will terminate the minimization.
