# fix ID group-ID langevin Tstart Tstop damp seed keyword values ...
# Apply a Langevin thermostat as described in (Schneider) to a group of atoms
# which models an interaction with a background implicit solvent. Used with
# fix nve, this command performs Brownian dynamics (BD), since the total force
# on each atom will have the form:
#
# F = Fc + Ff + Fr
# Ff = - (m / damp) v
# Fr is proportional to sqrt(Kb T m / (dt damp))
#
# Note that unless you use the omega or angmom keywords, the thermostat effect
# of this fix is applied to only the translational degrees of freedom for the
# particles, which is an important consideration for finite-size particles,
# which have rotational degrees of freedom, are being thermostatted. The
# translational degrees of freedom can also have a bias velocity removed
# from them before thermostatting takes place; see the description below.
#
# Unlike the fix nvt command which performs Nose/Hoover thermostatting
# AND time integration, this fix does NOT perform time integration. It
# only modifies forces to effect thermostatting. Thus you must use a
# separate time integration fix, like fix nve to actually update the
# velocities and positions of atoms using the modified forces. Likewise,
# this fix should not normally be used on atoms that also have their
# temperature controlled by another fix - e.g. by fix nvt or fix
# temp/rescale commands.
#
# The damp parameter is specified in time units and determines how rapidly the
# temperature is relaxed. For example, a value of 100.0 means to relax the
# temperature in a timespan of (roughly) 100 time units (tau or fmsec or psec
# - see the units command). The damp factor can be thought of as inversely
# related to the viscosity of the solvent. I.e. a small relaxation time
# implies a hi-viscosity solvent and vice versa. See the discussion about
# gamma and viscosity in the documentation for the fix viscous command for
# more details.

# As with the thermostats, the Nose/Hoover methods (fix npt and fix nph) perform
# time integration. Fix press/berendsen does NOT, so it should be used with one
# of the constant NVE fixes or with one of the NVT fixes.

#     group-ID = group of atoms whose coords are shifted
# 
# Constrain the center-of-mass position of a group of atoms by adjusting the 
# coordinates of the atoms every timestep. This is simply a small shift that 
# does not alter the dynamics of the system or change the relative coordinates 
# of any pair of atoms in the group. This can be used to insure the entire 
# collection of atoms (or a portion of them) do not drift during the simulation
# due to random perturbations (e.g. fix langevin thermostatting).
# 
# The center-of-mass (COM) is computed for the group specified by the fix. 
# If the current COM is different than the specified x,y,z, then a group of 
# atoms has their coordinates shifted by the difference. By default the shifted
# group is also the group specified by the fix. A different group can be shifted
# by using the shift keyword. For example, the COM could be computed on a 
# protein to keep it in the center of the simulation box. But the entire system 
# (protein + water) could be shifted.
#
# Distance units for the x,y,z values are determined by the setting of the units
# keyword, as discussed below. One or more x,y,z values can also be specified 
# as NULL, which means exclude that dimension from this operation. Or it can be
# specified as INIT which means to constrain the center-of-mass to its initial 
# value at the beginning of the run.

# The b constraint lists bond types that will be constrained.
# The t constraint lists atom types. All bonds connected to an

# lists atom masses. All bonds connected to atoms of the specified
# masses will be constrained (within a fudge factor of MASSDELTA specified
# in fix_shake.cpp). The a constraint lists angle types. If both bonds in

# The fix rattle command modifies forces and velocities and thus should be
# defined after all other integration fixes in your input script. If you
# define other fixes that modify velocities or forces after fix rattle operates,
# then fix rattle will not take them into account and the overall time
# integration will typically not satisfy the RATTLE constraints. You can
# check whether the constraints work correctly by setting the value of
# RATTLE_DEBUG in src/fix_rattle.cpp to 1 and recompiling LAMMPS.
# The degrees-of-freedom removed by SHAKE bonds and angles are accounted for in
# temperature and pressure computations. Similarly, the SHAKE contribution to
# the pressure of the system (virial) is also accounted for.
