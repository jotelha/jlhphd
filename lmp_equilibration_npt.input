# fix ID group-ID langevin Tstart Tstop damp seed keyword values ...
# Apply a Langevin thermostat as described in (Schneider) to a group of atoms
# which models an interaction with a background implicit solvent. Used with
# fix nve, this command performs Brownian dynamics (BD), since the total force
# on each atom will have the form:
#
# F = Fc + Ff + Fr
# Ff = - (m / damp) v
# Fr is proportional to sqrt(Kb T m / (dt damp))
#
# Note that unless you use the omega or angmom keywords, the thermostat effect
# of this fix is applied to only the translational degrees of freedom for the
# particles, which is an important consideration for finite-size particles,
# which have rotational degrees of freedom, are being thermostatted. The
# translational degrees of freedom can also have a bias velocity removed
# from them before thermostatting takes place; see the description below.
#
# Unlike the fix nvt command which performs Nose/Hoover thermostatting
# AND time integration, this fix does NOT perform time integration. It
# only modifies forces to effect thermostatting. Thus you must use a
# separate time integration fix, like fix nve to actually update the
# velocities and positions of atoms using the modified forces. Likewise,
# this fix should not normally be used on atoms that also have their
# temperature controlled by another fix - e.g. by fix nvt or fix
# temp/rescale commands.
#
# The damp parameter is specified in time units and determines how rapidly the
# temperature is relaxed. For example, a value of 100.0 means to relax the
# temperature in a timespan of (roughly) 100 time units (tau or fmsec or psec
# - see the units command). The damp factor can be thought of as inversely
# related to the viscosity of the solvent. I.e. a small relaxation time
# implies a hi-viscosity solvent and vice versa. See the discussion about
# gamma and viscosity in the documentation for the fix viscous command for
# more details.

# water bulk modulus: 2.15e9 Pa ~ 2.1e6 atm
# one or more keyword value pairs may be appended
# keyword = iso or aniso or x or y or z or couple or dilate or modulus
#   iso or aniso values = Pstart Pstop Pdamp
#     Pstart,Pstop = scalar external pressure at start/end of run (pressure units)
#     Pdamp = pressure damping parameter (time units)
#   x or y or z values = Pstart Pstop Pdamp
#     Pstart,Pstop = external stress tensor component at start/end of run (pressure units)
#     Pdamp = stress damping parameter (time units)

#   modulus value = bulk modulus of system (pressure units)

#
# Reset the pressure of the system by using a Berendsen barostat (Berendsen),
# which rescales the system volume and (optionally) the atoms coordinates within
#  the simulation box every timestep.
#
# Regardless of what atoms are in the fix group, a global pressure is computed
# for all atoms. Similarly, when the size of the simulation box is changed, all
# atoms are re-scaled to new positions, unless the keyword dilate is specified
# with a value of partial, in which case only the atoms in the fix group are
# re-scaled. The latter can be useful for leaving the coordinates of atoms in
# a solid substrate unchanged and controlling the pressure of a surrounding
# fluid.
#
# The relaxation time is actually also a function of the bulk modulus of the
# system (inverse of isothermal compressibility). The bulk modulus has units
# of pressure and is the amount of pressure that would need to be applied
# (isotropically) to reduce the volume of the system by a factor of 2
# (assuming the bulk modulus was a constant, independent of density, which it’s
#  not). The bulk modulus can be set via the keyword modulus. The Pdamp
# parameter is effectively multiplied by the bulk modulus, so if the pressure is
# relaxing faster than expected or desired, increasing the bulk modulus has the
# same effect as increasing Pdamp. The converse is also true. LAMMPS does not
# attempt to guess a correct value of the bulk modulus; it just uses 10.0 as a
# default value which gives reasonable relaxation for a Lennard-Jones liquid,
# but will be way off for other materials and way too small for solids. Thus
# you should experiment to find appropriate values of Pdamp and/or the modulus
# when using this fix.

# Constrain the center-of-mass position of a group of atoms by adjusting the
# coordinates of the atoms every timestep. This is simply a small shift that
# does not alter the dynamics of the system or change the relative coordinates
# of any pair of atoms in the group. This can be used to insure the entire
# collection of atoms (or a portion of them) do not drift during the simulation
# due to random perturbations (e.g. fix langevin thermostatting).
#
# The center-of-mass (COM) is computed for the group specified by the fix.
# If the current COM is different than the specified x,y,z, then a group of
# atoms has their coordinates shifted by the difference. By default the shifted
# group is also the group specified by the fix. A different group can be shifted
# by using the shift keyword. For example, the COM could be computed on a
# protein to keep it in the center of the simulation box. But the entire system
# (protein + water) could be shifted.
#
# Distance units for the x,y,z values are determined by the setting of the units
# keyword, as discussed below. One or more x,y,z values can also be specified
# as NULL, which means exclude that dimension from this operation. Or it can be
# specified as INIT which means to constrain the center-of-mass to its initial
# value at the beginning of the run.
