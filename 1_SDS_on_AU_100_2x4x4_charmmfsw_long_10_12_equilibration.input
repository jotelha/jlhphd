# Perform an energy minimization of the system, by iteratively adjusting atom
# coordinates. Iterations are terminated when one of the stopping criteria is
# satisfied. At that point the configuration will hopefully be in local
# potential energy minimum. More precisely, the configuration should
# approximate a critical point for the objective function (see below), which
# may or may not be a local minimum.
#
#    etol = stopping tolerance for energy (unitless)
#    ftol = stopping tolerance for force (force units)
#    maxiter = max iterations of minimizer
#    maxeval = max number of force/energy evaluations
#
# Either or both of the etol and ftol values can be set to 0.0, in which case
# some other criterion will terminate the minimization.

# The fix rattle command modifies forces and velocities and thus should be
# defined after all other integration fixes in your input script. If you
# define other fixes that modify velocities or forces after fix rattle operates,
# then fix rattle will not take them into account and the overall time
# integration will typically not satisfy the RATTLE constraints. You can
# check whether the constraints work correctly by setting the value of
# RATTLE_DEBUG in src/fix_rattle.cpp to 1 and recompiling LAMMPS.
# The degrees-of-freedom removed by SHAKE bonds and angles are accounted for in
# temperature and pressure computations. Similarly, the SHAKE contribution to
# the pressure of the system (virial) is also accounted for.
